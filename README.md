# Transfer-Learning-using-Xception-for-Art-genre-classification

This is a Jupyter Notebook that provides the pipeline that is required to make series of tests in order to find the best Convolutional Neural Network classifier in art genre. The code is written in Pythton and is based on Tensorflow. I am using Sentiment and Art Class Dataset, abbreviated as the _SeAC dataset_ [link](https://github.com/andreasgav/SeAC).

## Citation

Although the use of the available resources is free, a citation to the creators of the dataset is considered necessary. So if this coding examople is used as a whole or as a part of a project, we would encourage to reference to:
